##### For the nijor source code, see [Nijor](https://github.com/JapiAxom/nijor)
##### For the rollup plugin, see [nijor-rollup-plugin](https://github.com/JapiAxom/nijor-rollup-plugin)
This is a template Nijor website. <br>
## Get Started
Clone this Template.
```
git clone https://github.com/JapiAxom/nijor-template-website my-nijor-project
```
Then CD into the new folder:
```
cd my-nijor-project
```
Then type:
```
npm install
```
Start the server in one terminal:
```
npm start
```
Start the development compiler in another terminal. This will restart the compiler after any changes in .nijor and .js files:
```
npm run dev
```
Or start the compiler using:
```
npm run build
```
This will not restart the compiler after changes in .nijor and .js files.
##### Note: When you'll start the server for the first time, you would see nothing because you would first need to compile it.
##### Note: The compiler will issue some useless errors. But the Nijor files will be compiled and a message "Nijor Compilation Successful" will be printed in the console. This proeblem will be fixed in the future very soon.
